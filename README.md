GENI-Cinema
===========
GENI Cinema is a project which is meant to provide a high quality video streaming service to its users. One great example of this is a Professor who might want to share a video stream of his lecture with his students.

This project is funded by the NSF as a part of the Geni Project, which is a nationwide testbed for networking tests.
